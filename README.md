# LogUI Client <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl"><img align="right" width="100" src="./.meta/tudelft.svg" /></a>

**Note to ECIR reviewers:** We are in the process of refactoring the LogUI code, incorporating the final features as presented in the demonstration paper you are reading. In a few weeks' time, implementation of a beta version will be complete. Implementing a framework of this complexity takes time to get right, and we're sure you'll find the end result beneficial for the community. (2020-10-30)

*LogUI* is a powerful, framework-agnostic client-side JavaScript library that can be used for logging interactions that take place on a webpage. Primarily designed for *Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR)* experiments, LogUI can in theory be used on any page or site that you wish to track fine-grained user interactions with UI components.

Use the LogUI client in tandem with the LogUI server. At the time of writing, a Django implementation is available at [this repository](https://github.com/maxwelld90/logui-server-django/).

## About LogUI

The LogUI library is implemented by [David Maxwell](https://github.com/maxwelld90/), a postdoctoral researcher at [TUDelft](https://www.tudelft.nl/) in the Netherlands. The library is borne out of the need for infrastructure that allows one to undertake the logging of user interactions in a consistent way, rather than the piecemeal approach that we've seen in IIR experimentation.

We think that a one-size-fits-all logging library is just the ticket for your experiments!

## Installing and Building LogUI

To be completed.

## Quickstart

The following basic steps can be used to quickly get everything going.

## Documentation

The documentation will be written as a GitHub Wiki. This is in development as the library is implemented.

## Tests

We have implemented a series of tests to ensure that LogUI functions as expected.

## Found a Bug or have a Feature Request?

It would be great to hear from you! Please raise an issue in this repository and we can discuss what options we can pursue.

## Using LogUI?

If you are planning on using the LogUI library in your projects, it would be great if you could provide due credit.
