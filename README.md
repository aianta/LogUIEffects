# LogUI Client <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl"><img align="right" width="100" src="./.meta/tudelft.svg" /></a>

**Welcome to LogUI!** *LogUI* is a powerful, framework-agnostic client-side JavaScript library that can be used for logging interactions that take place on a webpage. Primarily designed for *Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR)* experiments, LogUI can in theory be used on any page or site that you wish to track fine-grained user interactions with UI components.

Use the LogUI client in tandem with the LogUI server. You can find the LogUI server living at [this repository](https://github.com/logui-framework/server/).

## About LogUI

The LogUI library is implemented by [Dr David Maxwell](https://github.com/maxwelld90/), a postdoctoral researcher at [TUDelft](https://www.tudelft.nl/) in the Netherlands. It has been developed in the Lambda Lab, headed by [Dr Claudia Hauff](https://chauff.github.io/). The library is borne out of the need for infrastructure that allows one to undertake the logging of user interactions in a consistent way, rather than the piecemeal approach that we've seen in IIR experimentation.

We think that a one-size-fits-all logging library is just the ticket for your experiments!

## Using LogUI in Experiments?

We're thrilled that you're using LogUI in your experiments! We ask that in return you provide due credit for this work. If you have a paper associated with your experiment, please do cite the associated demonstration paper that was published at [ECIR 2021](https://www.ecir2021.eu/). You can find the BibTeX source for the paper below.

## Documentation and Quick Start Guide

For documentation on the LogUI client library, please go and check the corresponding Wiki associated with this repository. There, you'll find detailed information about how to [acquire yourself a copy](https://github.com/logui-framework/client/wiki/Acquiring), how to [set the client library up](https://github.com/logui-framework/client/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide), how to integrate it with your existing application's code, and information which should allow you to gain a better understanding as to the thinking behind the library's implementation.

## Tests

Tests are being developed for the LogUI client library and will be available in this repository soon.
